Project 2: IC image analysis for counterfeit detection

Logan Schmalz, Aidan Schmelzle, Will Thomas

Objective: Develop a tool to automatically analyze the image of an IC to identify specific
features that are useful for counterfeit detection.

Part I (Pin defect detection): Identify all IC pins and then identify any inconsistencies or
defects that may exist in the image. Takes image input and outputs a new image with marked pins.

Part II (IC marking detection): Extract and report any marking text on the IC surface of the IC.
